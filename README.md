I've made this Patatap Clone while taking course in Front-End Development. It was one of a "code along" assignments included in the video bootcamp. I've been using HTML, CSSa and some JavaScript. This project recquires Paper.js and Howler.js libraries as well.

Fun starts here! ---> https://trykpa.github.io/patatap-clone-project/
